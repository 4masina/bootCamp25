    <!-- Global vs Local Scope
Write a function that declares a variable inside the function and another variable outside the function. Call the function and try to access both variables inside and outside the function. Observe the behavior and explain what happened.
Odd or Even
Write a function that determines whether a number is odd or even.
Calculate Total
Create a function called calculateTotal that calculates the total cost of a purchase, including tax.
The function should take two parameters: price (a number representing the price of the item) and taxRate (a number representing the tax rate as a decimal, e.g. 0.08 for 8%).
The function should calculate the total cost by adding the price and the amount of tax, which is calculated by multiplying the price by the tax rate.
The function should then return the total cost as a string with two decimal places.
Finally, log the result of calling the function with a price of 20 and a tax rate of 0.1. Hint: Remember to properly scope your variables within the function to prevent naming conflicts and to ensure that they are only accessible where they are needed. -->
